# Network Analysis of Makerspace Collaboration

This project's goal was to implement Network Analysis to visualize and analyze collaboration within a Makerspace.

## Installation

The main file of this project is the 'markerspace_louis.ipynb' file.
To work it needs librairies, that are imported in its first cell, as well as data periods, which are built using the data_processing notebook.

## Usage

This project was made using the data of the makerspace study of Harvard's LIT lab, and considering that it contains names and private information of students, that data is not uploaded to the git.

To work properly, this notebook needs to be linked to the raw data of the Lab's research, all outputs have been saved in the graphs folder.

The metrics and analysis used in the project can be easily adapted for other social networks by changing a few variables.
